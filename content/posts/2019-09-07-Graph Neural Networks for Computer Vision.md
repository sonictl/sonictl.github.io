# Graph Neural Networks for Computer Vision
### I was attracted by this image:

This is an inspiring image and it was posted in this article: **Tutorial on Graph Neural Networks for Computer Vision and Beyond (Part 1)** written by **Boris**, a PhD student at University of Guelph.

The figure I attached above is showing some possibilities that using the graph structure to represent the version components in a fuzzy way. That's innovative and interesting.
