# Use Keyboard Mastero to enable delete_forward for Mac 


The 'delete' on MacBook's keyboard cannot delete the letter on the right of the cursor. Rather than the delete and backspace key on the PC's keyboard.

With the help of 'Keyboard Mastero' tool, steps:

 - Add a 'Trigger of hot key' and a action of 'Type a Keystroke' from Categories 'Text'

 - The 'Simulate keystroke' blank can be filled with pressing the 'delete key' on the PC's keyboard, i.e. 'Forward Delete'.
