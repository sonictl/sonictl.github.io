Let me share some thoughts bout creating academic research paper. 



## How to find the innovative ideas for a new paper

A new idea is believed by the newbee PhD  student a precious seed for his/her paper. And the papers are believed as their lifesaver for their tough days.



**Solution:** 

a. adjust the mindset. A book named as ‘phD grind’ written by Philip Guo may helps.

b. In your research area, hack up a classical work, a hot research work, a gorgeous work or a work you just want to hack up. Hack up it by disassembly it’s paper, diggest it, implement it by your hand and your code.

c. Wait for your brain’s fission after your implemented the paper with your own code.

The more algorithm you implemented, the more ideas you’ll have.
