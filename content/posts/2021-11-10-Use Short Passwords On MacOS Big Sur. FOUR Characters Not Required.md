## Use Short Passwords On MacOS Big Sur. FOUR Characters Not Required.

If you’re an Apple user and have macOS Big Sur, Catalina or Mojave installed on your machine you’ve probably realized you can’t use a password shorter than 4 characters anymore…

Luckily, here is the easy fix.

#### 1. Open “Terminal” on your machine.

#### 2. Type this command & press Return (enter):
	`pwpolicy -clearaccountpolicies`

#### 3. Terminal will ask you to enter the password for your admin profile.
Terminal WILL NOT show the password as you type it.
After typing the password for your account, press “Return” (enter).

#### 4. You’re all done! Yes, it really is that easy. Now, just go into your System Preferences > Users & Groups & reset your password to any password you’d like.
